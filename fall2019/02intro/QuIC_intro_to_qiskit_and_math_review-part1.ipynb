    "By the end of last semester, we had gotten into some pretty complicated quantum algorithms (Shor, VQE, etc...). With the new semester upon us, us seminar organizers wanted a way to simultaneously get new people involved and keep QuIC veterans engaged and interested.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we decided to take a hands on approach. This semester, we intend to do a lot of actual hands on programing using IBM's Qiskit package. Qiskit is a python library built to design and execute programs on the actual, small scale quantum computers that IBM runs at its various labs, as well as benchmark the performance/noise of those devices. With any luck, by the end of the semester we'll be running real programs on real quantum computers. However, for this first seminar, instead of connecting to an actual quantum computer, everything you do will be simulated locally on your laptop. \n",
    "\n",
    "This first seminar will in some sense not be a seminar at all: we've prepared a jupyter notebook that runs through some review/introduction to some of the mathematical concepts used in quantum computing/quantum information science, and simultaneously introduces some fundamentals of writing code using Qiskit. There are some <font color=\"red\">exercises</font> in red scattered throughout the notebook that you should do to get a handle on the math/software. We suggest you group up to discuss the concepts/exercises presented here, especially if you're not familiar with quantum mechanics and/or programing in python. And, most of all, if something is confusing/unclear...\n",

    "As many of you probably know, a <b>bit</b> is the fundamental unit of classical information. A bit is a letter in \"the worlds simplest alphabet\", either $1$ or $0.$ Just the English alphabet, we represent more complicated information by concatenating many bits together. For example, we can convert the decimal number $12$ to our bitwise alphabet (binary) by $$12 = 8 + 4 = 1\\times2^3 + 1\\times2^2 + 0\\times2^1 + 0\\times2^0 = 1100$$ Information processing is the process of taking information and modifying it to complete a specific task. Classical computers have had much success proccessing information by taking in that information as a string of bits and applying a series __logic gates__ to those bits. These logic gates are simple operations that input 1-2 bits and output 1 bit. For example, the AND gate takes in 2 bits, outputs $1$ if both inputs are $1$, and outputs $0$ otherwise. A list of fundamental logic gates can be found __here__, and isn't to necessary for the subject at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, bits and logic gates are much more than mathematical abstractions: in your computer, bits are created by the states of transistors (more or less tiny switches) that can either be in one of two physical states (\"on\" ($1$) or \"off\" ($0$)), and gates are executed with small transistor circuits. This leads to an idea that idea that will (hopefully) permeate this seminar series: that information (classical or quantum) only exist in the context of the physical system on which it is encoded: transistors, transmon qubits, paper, neurons, electron spins, stone tablets. Information, and the flow of information, is a very real, physical thing. In the words of [Rolf Landauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Landauer): __information is physical__. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum bit, or __qubit__, is the fundamental unit of quantum information. Much like a classical bit, a qubit is represented by two states: $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. However, unlike a classical bit, which must be in either $0$ or $1$, a qubit may be in a superposition of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since information is physical, to a physicist a qubit is any two level quantum system, or two levels of a higher dimensional quantum system that we can isolate. For example, we could make a qubit out of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field, with $|0\\rangle$ being the spin down configuration and $|1\\rangle$ being the spin up configuration. We could also make a qubit out of the $n=0$ (ground) and $n=1$ (first excited) states of a quantum harmonic oscillator (provided we have a way of isolating those two states from the rest of the harmonic oscillator ladder!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we represent a qubit as a __vector in $\\mathbb{C}^2$__, which is shorthand for a two dimensional vector with complex amplitudes (we call the vector space that quantum state vectors live in __Hilbert space__ and commonly denote it as $\\mathcal{H}$.) $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are orthogonal vectors in $\\mathcal{H}$, and thus form a complete basis in this vector space, which we call the __computational basis__. We commonly write down the state vector of a qubit in either standard vector notation, or in Dirac Bra-Ket notation: $$\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ \\text{or}\\\\ |\\psi\\rangle = a|0\\rangle + b|1\\rangle$$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers. We also demand that this state vector is normalized, i.e. the __inner product__ of the state with itself is equal to one \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a^* & b^* \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build some intuition for handling qubits as mathematical objects, lets actually make a qubit in the Qiskit software. Qiskit is designed to create, execute, and simulate programs on a quantum computer using what's called the circuit model of quantum computing. We'll talk more about the circuit model later; for now, let's just initialize a single qubit in an empty circuit (i.e., initialize a qubit and don't do anything to it) and print it out: "

Additionally, observables are __Hermitian__, or self adjoint: $$(\\mathbf{A}|\\phi\\rangle)^\\dagger|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi|\\mathbf{A}^\\dagger|\\psi\\rangle= |\\phi\\rangle^\\dagger(\\mathbf{A}|\\psi\\rangle) = \\langle\\phi|\\mathbf{A}|\\psi\\rangle$$\n",

This evolution happens according to the Schrödinger equation $$ i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial|\\psi(t)\\rangle}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H}|\\psi(t)\\rangle$$ where $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator. Since the Shrödinger equation is a linear differential equation, we can \"solve\"  ease: $$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{\\frac{-i\\hat{H} t}{\\hbar}}|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\mathbf{U}(t)|\\psi(0)\\rangle$$ \n",

    "where we've written down the scary looking term with an operator in the exponent as a (linear) operator $\\mathbf{U}(t)$. What can we say about this operator?  Well, for a qubit, this is a linear operator that takes a two dimensional state vector at time to a new two dimensional state vector: just like the measurement operator $\\mathbf{A}$ we talked about, it's a matrix! Formally, it's a 2 x 2 matrix (that may also be complex): $\\mathbf{U}(t) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n\\text{x}n}$.\n",

    "As a side note, $\\mathbf{U}(t)$ is a __unitary operator__: $\\mathbf{U}^{\\dagger}\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{UU}^{\\dagger} = 1$. The unitarity of the time evolution operator $\\mathbf{U}(t)$ is required to enforce our normalization constraint. If this isn't clear to you, $\\color{red}{\\text{think about what we specified } \\langle\\psi(t)|\\psi(t)\\rangle \\text{ should be equal to.}}$ Should this quantity change as a function of time?\n",

    "In reality, trying to write down a Hamiltonian that does a complex calculation for a large number of qubits would be a nightmare. To simplify the matter, we'll break up the time evolution of the qubit into bite-sized __gates__ that we can reliably execute. Since, at the end of the day, these gates represent evolution of the qubit over small chunks of time, we write them down as unitary matrices. We'll leave the fine details of the Hamiltonian required to execute these gates to the experimentalists building our quantum computer: we'll assume for now that we can apply a gate described by the (unitary) matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ to our qubit, which will evolve the state vector of the qubit from $|\\psi\\rangle \\rightarrow \\mathbf{U}|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",

On a circuit, the Hadamard is generally written down as a box with an $H$ in it.\n",

We start off (on the left) with all our qubits initialized to the $|0\\rangle$ state. As we move forward in time (right along the circuit) we apply some gates (which we visualize with labeled boxes) to our qubits (which \"live\" on the horizontal lines.) At the end of the day, once we've performed our computation, we measure some/all of the qubits to get the results of the computation. \n",

You can modify the circuit by adding more gates to your qubits, or by adding more qubits/classical readout bits to the circuit. Common gates include the Pauli matrices, which you can add by to the $n^{th}$ qubit with (say, for $\\sigma_x$) ```circ.x(n)``` \n"
