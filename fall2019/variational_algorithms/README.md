Contains two Jupyter notebooks:
1) An intro to variational algorithms
2) Using an algorithm called the vatiational qantum eigensolver (VQE) to solve for the energy of molecular hydrogen.

Both of these notebooks were originally written by Ryan LaRose and lightly modified by Justin Lane for use in the Fall 2019 QuIC-seninar series.
